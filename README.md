# SWG Profession calculator Animus

This project is a fork of the SWG Profession calculator by Marc Joyce. 
https://github.com/MarcJoyce/SWGProfessionCalculator/tree/main/src

I only updated the CONSTANTS to fit with the changes on Animus server.
Small changes to the js to try to accommodate new single tree legendary professions.
Added CH Legend as first.

# TODO 
Add additional Legendary professions.
Tidy up the css.
General checkup of values.

## TODO {from original project):
- Add Jedi & FRS trees
- Add JTL trees
- Add Character section for armor, weapons, ca/aa, food etc and a damage calculator for common enemies similar to the damage calculators at https://web.archive.org/web/20200217162633/http://www.swgcalc.x10.mx//
- Ideas for the future (?)
